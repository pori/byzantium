TO FIX:

NOTES: 
-When a unit dies, leave a gravestone, like in Worms
-It would be interesting for different unit classes to have different movement patterns, like in chess
-Conversations between characters could be centered around trash talk; the character who loses ends up with a lower accuracy because they're mad
